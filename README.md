# Web-development
This folder is a collection of HTML and CSS files. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) files define the structure and content of a web page, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) files determine the visual style and layout of the web page. Together, they form the backbone of web development, enabling the creation of beautifully structured websites.
